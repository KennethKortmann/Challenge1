  <p class="blocktext">Morioka (盛岡) is the capital city of <a class="red" href="#"> Iwate Prefecture</a>, 2.5 hours by shinkansen north of <a class="red" href="#">Tokyo</a>. Surrounded by mountains on three sides and blessed with multiple rivers, Morioka is an attractive city and a convenient transportation hub, but lacks a major sightseeing spot. The city is well known for its various styles of noodles, though, and does offer a handful of minor sites of interest.</p>

  <h2>Wanko Soba</h2>
  <p>Eating Wanko Soba is an experience in itself. Each serving contains roughly a mouthful of soba noodles, and the server will constantly keep topping up your empty bowl with more noodles until you indicate that you have had enough.</p>
