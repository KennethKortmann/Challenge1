  <h3>Morioka (盛岡) is the capital city of <u><b>Iwate Prefecture</b></u>, 2.5 hours by shinkansen north of <u><b>Tokyo</b></u>. Surrounded by mountains on three sides and blessed with multiple rivers, Morioka is an attractive city and a convenient transportation hub, but lacks a major sightseeing spot. The city is well known for its various styles of noodles, though, and does offer a handful of minor sites of interest.</h3>

  <h2>Wanko Soba</h2>
  <h3>Eating Wanko Soba is an experience in itself. Each serving contains roughly a mouthful of soba noodles, and the server will constantly keep topping up your empty bowl with more noodles until you indicate that you have had enough.</h3>
